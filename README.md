# Base Spark Bot framework using ngrok

This is a base Spark Bot framework using ngrok. You can use it to start your Spark Bot project if you are developing on your local machine. The code does not have any business logic defined, you will have to add it. When a new message is posted to the Bot, the code will simply display the message to the terminal.
